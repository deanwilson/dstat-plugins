"dstat - versatile tool for generating system resource statistics"
  -- From the Debian dstat manpage

Sometimes you need resource statistics from a source that the original
author didn't include. This git repo contains some of mine.

The simplest way to use them is to drop the .py file in to ~/.dstat and
then run dstat with the -M filename option.

Example - 

mkdir ~/.dstat
cp ~/dstat_proccount.py ~/.dstat
dstat -a -M proccount

== Plugins ==

proccount - shows the total number of current processes.

memcache_hits - shows the total "get" hits and misses.
                This is an absolute number, not an incremental
                difference between runs.
